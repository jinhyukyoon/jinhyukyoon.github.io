              Haptic interactions play an essential role in education to enhance learning efficiency;
              however, haptic information for virtual educational content remains lacking.

              This work proposes a planar cable-driven haptic interface with movable bases that can display isotropic force feedback with maximum workspace extension on a commercial screen display.

              A generalized kinematic and static analysis of the cable-driven mechanism is derived by considering movable pulleys.
              Based on the analyses, a system including movable bases is designed and controlled to maximize the workspace subject to isotropic force exertion for the target screen area.

              The proposed system is evaluated experimentally as a haptic interface represented by the workspace, isotropic force-feedback range, bandwidth, Z-width, and user experiment.
              The results indicate that the proposed system can maximize workspace to the target rectangular area and exert isotropic force up to 94.0% of the theoretical computed one within the workspace.

                Virtual exhibits with haptic feedback offer greater flexibility in diversifying content and providing digital affordance, even at a lower cost, than physical exhibits.
                However, few studies addressed the value of such haptics-enabled educational systems in informal learning environments.
                In this study, we investigated the feasibility of a haptic exhibit as an alternative or supplement for a traditional physical exhibit in a science museum.
                We developed a two-degree-of-freedom cable-driven haptic device to simulate physical interactions on a large visual display.
                Choosing a seesaw-like physical exhibit available in a local museum, we designed and implemented a virtual lever simulation closely embodying the physics principles that the physical exhibit showcased. 
                Then, we conducted an observational user study with children to compare the exhibit-visitor interaction behaviors, learning effects, and self-reported motivation and enjoyment between the physical and virtual exhibits.
                The results revealed that the visitors well-received and engaged with the haptic exhibit, instantiating its potential application in diverse learning settings.

                Physical buttons provide clear haptic feedback when pressed and released, but their responses are unvarying.
                Physical buttons can be powered by force actuators to produce unlimited click sensations, but the cost is substantial.

                An alternative can be augmenting physical buttons with simple and inexpensive vibration actuators. 
                When pushed, an augmented button generates a vibration overlayed on the button’s original kinesthetic response, under the general framework of haptic augmented reality.

                We explore the design space of augmented buttons while changing vibration frequency, amplitude, duration, and envelope. 
                We then visualize the perceptual structure of augmented buttons by estimating a perceptual space for 7 physical buttons and 40 augmented buttons.
                Their sensations are also assessed against adjectives, and results are mapped into the perceptual space to identify meaningful perceptual dimensions.

              Dynamic analysis of hinge takes important part on developing digital oven.
              Traditional method that uses a computational simulation software, however, takes complicated manipulation process.
              Hence, it cannot provide reverse engineering, which modifies dynaimc property such as torque and results in a desired hinge profile.
              Interactive Torque Designer solves these problems through dynamic analysis and web application which even enables interactive design with graphical modification.<br>
              <div class="row">

              Web application has universality and scalability.
              Any user can use this application only with internet browser and adapting additional function requires just simple programming.
              Using d3.js library, plotted data enables to reflect dynamic analysis result graphically.
              Consequently, user can get torque profile data only with manipulating visualized cam profile data and vice versa.

              Direct user experience feedbacks of field engineers according to iterative design process suggests multiple drag and other functions which make design process more easily.
              With the final version of Interactive Torque Designer, user can intuitively analyze torque and do the inverse engineering, which significantly simplifies mechanical design process of digital oven.
              Furthermore, it helps engineer to explain to other division members about mechanical phenomena through graphical expression.

              Art work at 2017 Artience Creation Challenge 30x30, 30 hours straight collaboration work with one artist.
              British Council Korea hosted and Daejeon Culture and Arts Foundation supported the challenge.
              To express challenge topic ageing, we chose entropy which measures disorder and indicates direction of time.<br>

              Video art work shows increase of entropy with getting aged person.
              Performer fills paint named life on white drawing paper named time, as being covered up with rope named disorder.
              Just as life, performer shows her agony as holding and dropping brush or trying to break the rope.
              However, inside of irrefutable and natural flow of entropy, she finally accepts disorder which fully covered up her body at ease.<br><br>
              Since competition started with zero-based, team had to find an idea to metaphor ageing through a compact communication.
              Conversation lasted about 6 hours as sharing knowledge, experience and technique of each other.

              Partner had majored ballet around 10 years.
              Using this strength facilitated expression of ageing through tangled rope and randomly painted drawing paper, which also resembled notion of entropy.
              Limitation in time and resources of the competition restricted shooting subject to non-professional, field, or daily products.

              Connecting two different backgrounds and overcoming difficulty of 30 hours straight work produced successful visual metaphor for concept of entropy and ageing through video art.
              This work described entrophy and ageing in intuitive manner to the judge and participant and won the Runners-Up of the competition.

              During one month before the class, every member prepared his/her own class contents individually.
              As taking part of class planning, experience of science communication suggested making a toy which includes actual movement with motors and created explanation of basic concept of electromagnetism.
              After preparation, all members gathered and rehearsed class including drawing and hands-on activity.

              Each class took around 4 hours and team met about 40 children in total.
              Through class and activities, class delivered basic concept of electromagnetism such as current, voltage, resistance and electron to the children.
              Children filled the picture book and made a toy with diverse styles and movements.
              After the end of the class, children effectively linked their knowledge learned from the class to describe the movement of the toy.
